Minor bugs
----------

Sometimes the log view is repainted incorrectly when you are in grouped view
with a scrollbar, and add an entry for an existing activity.

Unimplemented features
----------------------

Use a consistent location of timelog.txt (rather than forcing the user to
always chdir to the same directory), perhaps ~/.gtimelog/timelog.txt?

Let the user specify his name, at least (currently "Daily report for Marius"
is hardcoded).

Re-reading of timelog.txt should be automatic (watch mtime of the file).
